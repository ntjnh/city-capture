# City Capture

City Capture is a gallery of photos showcasing cities around the world.

This is a recreation of a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ntjnh/pen/JyKWPE) I made a few years ago while practicing HTML and CSS.

The app is built with React and uses the following tools:
- [Masonry](https://masonry.desandro.com/)
- [imagesLoaded](https://imagesloaded.desandro.com/)
- [Lightbox2](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/)
